Automated Prerequisite Knowledge Assessment & Gap Analysis Tool

An intelligent, adaptive system that evaluates a student’s prerequisite knowledge for a course, identifies gaps, and generates a personalized bridge-learning curriculum to ensure they are fully prepared before starting.

 Project Overview

Students enter advanced courses with different levels of prior knowledge. Manually identifying each student's strengths and weaknesses is time-consuming and difficult to scale.

This tool automates the entire process by:

Assessing a student's current knowledge through adaptive questioning

Identifying specific micro-skill gaps
